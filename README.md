# Notion Boards

This program uses <a href="https://developers.notion.com/" target="_blank">Notion's API</a> and is designed to provide a mobile interface to interact with different databases on a user's <a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank">Notion</a> account.

## Installation

This project is still under development, and as such, official releases are not available for now. Those who are interested in testing or contributing to the project may build the project using Flutter.

## Usage

The application itself should be fairly intuitive to use. Users will be able to register/login to accounts through the application, after which they will be allowed to use the rest of the features of the application through their account.

## Contributing

To contribute to this project, please create a fork of the main branch and make changes there. Once you are done, create a pull request. A member of the development team will review the changes as soon as possible and will integrate it if it is accepted.
